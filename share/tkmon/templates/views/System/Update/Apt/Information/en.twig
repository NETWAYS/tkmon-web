<p>
    Install system updates regularly to keep your system up-to-date. System
    updates include Ubuntu security updates and updates of TKmon and Icinga.

<h5>Keep configuration files unmodified</h5>

<p>
    Avoid manual changes of configuration files on the system. Doing so ensures
    the proper function of TKmon.

<h5>When an update fails</h5>

<p>
    Under certain conditions an update may need manual intervention to run
    successfully. This happens for example when a configuration file has been
    manually altered. In such situations the packaging system needs to know
    whether the original contents of the configuration file, or the altered
    content should be used. Whenever this happens, you have to run the update
    manually on the command line by executing "apt-get dist-upgrade" (e.g. via
    SSH). Then you can answer questions of the packing system interactively.

    <h5>Common words about manual changes</h5>
    <p>
        <i class="icon-thumbs-up icon-4x pull-left"></i>
        You are free to make any manual changes on the system. In this case we
        assume that you are familiar with Linux systems and that you can solve
        problems yourself. When you want to install additional software, we
        recommend to install only packages provided by the offical Ubuntu
        repository. As mentioned above, updates via this webinterface may fail
        when configuration files are modified manually.
